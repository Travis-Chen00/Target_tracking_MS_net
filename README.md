# Target Tracking with Minimal Surprise network

## Model

**Heat Minimal Surprise (Heat-MS)**

Our model is based on the Heat Minimal Surprise (Heat-MS) framework. This approach integrates the concept of "heat" into the minimal surprise network for the target tracking. <br/>

### Heat Zone
<span style="color:red">Red: *Dangerous Zone*.</span> 
- Too close to the target, swarms should avoid. 

<span style="color:orange">Orange: *Safety Zone*.</span> 
- All swarms in this zone are perfect. 

<span style="color:blue">Blue: *Cold Zone*.</span> 
- Too far away from the target.

The red zone, which has the highest temperature, represents the closest place to the target. If some swarms stay in this area, they can be an obstacle and block the movement of the target, so, swarms should avoid this area. Similarly, all positions in the blue zone are too far from the target. In this area, swarms can feel cold and fail to follow the target. On the other hand, the orange zone enjoys the second-highest temperature; this place illustrates perfect tracking. 
**Heat intensity** [\[10.1162/isal_a_00650\]](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/isal_a_00650) \( \delta \) decreases with distance to the target as given by

where L<sub>x</sub> and L<sub>y</sub> are the lengths and the widths of the grid world, D<sub>ST</sub> is the Euclidean distance to the target, and Î´ (delta) is the temperature rate for these three zones, which are 0.2 for the blue zone, 0.7 for the orange zone, and 0.1 for the red zone. Equation (1) normalized the heat intensity H between 0 and 1, resulting in maximum light intensity *H* = 1 in the target and a light intensity of approximately zero at the corners.


### Sensors
5 Temperature sensors + 1 proximity sensor
- Temperature Sensor is in the same location as S0

## Training Strategy

**Genetic Algorithm**

We employ the [Genetic Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) as our primary training strategy.

## Target Moving Strategy

The target will move in the beginning of each generation, the range of its location is [0, SizeX], [0, SizeY]
